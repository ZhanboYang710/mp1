                    <p>Hello, my friend. My name is Zhanbo Yang. I am a senior at Boston University
                        studying Computer Science and Statistics. I also major in Economics and has 
                        finished all the curriculums in it. However, it will be pretty obvious to 
                        everyone that I am lacking a bit of working experience. Therefore, I hope to
                        participate in internships and entry level jobs as soon as possible.
